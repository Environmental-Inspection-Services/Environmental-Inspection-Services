<p>Mold inspections are especially crucial when buying or selling property. For buyers, we offer insights into potential hazards before finalizing a purchase.

<h2>Asbestos Inspections: Identifying Hidden Risks</h2>
<p>Asbestos, once commonly used in building materials, is now known to cause severe health problems, including lung cancer and mesothelioma. Our asbestos inspection services are designed to identify and assess the presence of asbestos in your property, whether it&rsquo;s a historic home, a commercial building, or a site undergoing demolition.</p>
<p>Our certified inspectors thoroughly examine insulation, roofing, floor tiles, and textured coatings to determine if asbestos is present. Though often invisible, these fibers become hazardous when disturbed and released into the air. With accurate testing and detailed reporting, we equip you with the knowledge to address these risks safely and effectively.</p>

<h2>Conflict-Free Testing You Can Trust</h2>
<p>At Environmental Inspection Services, we believe in providing impartial, conflict-free assessments. Unlike companies that combine testing and remediation services, we focus solely on inspections, ensuring our evaluations are unbiased and trustworthy. This approach eliminates any potential for unnecessary repairs or inflated costs, giving you confidence in the integrity of our findings.</p>
